# README for the Bin Edge Finder for the SUS-19-004 Analysis

## Last Updated by Kelvin Mei on February 16, 2021

The purpose of the scripts in this folder is to derive the bin edges from miniTrees.
The version that was used in determining the bin edges for the analysis is called `binAnalyzer.py`.
Meanwhile, the script that is cleaned up is `findBinEdges.py`.

All the defaults for the script are the same as used to find the bin edges, though there are extra flags for debugging and to change the size of the expected systematic.
